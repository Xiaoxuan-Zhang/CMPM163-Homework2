Heightmap and Particles

A. A tranquil place among the mountains<br />
   
   Controls: You can room in and room out to see the whole layout of the scene. When you view the water from above, you can see the refraction from the bottom of the water. When you view from lower angle, you can see the water reflecting the skybox. Point sprites are added in the scene to create a dreamy atmosphere.
